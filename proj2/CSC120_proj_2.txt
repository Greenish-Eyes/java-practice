Planning Your Solution
1. To find the course id what symbol should you find the location of? What method can you use to do this?
To find the course id, I should find the location of “_”(space). To do this I will use the indexOf method.
2. What method will allow you to extract the course id from the full string?
The substring method will allow me to extract the course id from the full string.
3. To separate the course number from the department and section, you will need to use the locations of the “-“.
int secondHyphen = courseInfo.indexOf("-", posOfHyphen + 1);
4.  The course name is at the end of the string. What symbol indicates that the course name will follow?
The third hyphen.
5.  How will you get the section? Can you use the method from either #3 or #4 to help you find where the section ends?
I use one of the previous lines ( from question3):
int secondHyphen = courseInfo.indexOf("-", posOfHyphen + 1);
And write other lines to find section:
int secondSpace = courseInfo.indexOf(" ", posOfSpace + 1);
section = courseInfo.substring(secondHyphen + 1, secondSpace);
