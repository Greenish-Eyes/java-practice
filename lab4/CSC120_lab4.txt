1. What is wrong with the following statement?
Table myFavoritePlace = new Restaurant();
There are two different types of classes. That will cause a syntax error.


2. There are three parts to the following statement:
Table tbl = new Table(4);
Explain each of these parts below. Hint: it is similar to String str = new String(“Hi!”);
a) Table tbl
Declare a new variable.
b) new Table(4);
It sets default values for all the instance variables except the number of guests onto the new Int object.
c) tbl = ... ; // what is being stored in tbl based upon the previous parts?
In tbl is being stored the number of guests.


3. Look through the documentation to determine what class contains the calcBill method. 
The calcBill method is contained in the Table class.
Explain two problems with the following statement.
calcBill( );

7. What is the wording of the syntax error message?
Type mismatch: cannot convert from Table to Restaurant.


8. What do you think this error means?
It means that classes should be the same.


9. Is this the same type of error as the last syntax error? How do you know?
Yes. We put the mouse on the red cross.


10. What is the wording of the syntax error message?
The method assignServer() is undefined for the type Table


11. What do you think this error means?
The method assignServer() is used for the type Restaurant, so we need to rewrite the assignment.
